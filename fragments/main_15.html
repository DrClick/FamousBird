<p>I currently work at Labelmaster in Seattle. We make awesome software that helps you NOT screw up shipping hazardous materials. You know, things like those Lithium Batteries that blow up! We consume a MASSIVE set of govt regulations and make shipping that shit childs play.</p> <p>Got a missile you want shipped? We do that (for real)!
